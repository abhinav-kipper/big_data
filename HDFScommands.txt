HDFS Commands
Create a file a.txt on local file system
Use vim as wont get other editors always

1.Copy a file from LFS to HDFS
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal src_destination target_destination
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/mudgal_abhinav19/a.txt /user/mudgal_abhinav19/
This fs is like object of file system as hadoop is in java

/user/mudgal_abhinav19/ ----This because only have access to place here on hadoop not elsewhere

All replicas created divided on data nodes Everything done.
We just putted the file to the HDFS.

Here Edupristine might have Replication factor 1.

This is similiar to how we work in Real time Production
Winscp Small files transfer

2.Change content of file a.txt on hdfs directly
Hadoop is WRITE once Read many times.
It means cannot do it after putting on HDFS.
So Delete the file.And place the modified file back to HDFS.


In Real works, Data comes from other sources Logs,databases etc
We generally dont put dataon Hadoop.
Just its made to analyse the data.

Its not the Replacement of RDBMS.

OLTP : Real time Processing
OLAP : Analytics Processing  

3. Copy a file from HDFS to LFS
A.Create a dir in LFS name data
B.hadoop fs -copyToLocal /user/username/a.txt /home/username/data

4.Create a directory on HDFS
hadoop fs  -mkdir /user/username/my_datasets

4.Copy data from one HDFS Location to  other HDFS location
hadoop fs -cp /user/mudgal_abhinav19/a.txt /user/mudgal_abhinav19/my_datasets/

5.Rename or move a file on hdfs
hadoop fs -mv /user/mudgal_abhinav/my_datasets/a.txt
/user/mudgal_abhinav/my_datasets/b.txt

6. put ----alternate of copyFromLocal
hadoop fs -put /home/mudgal_abhinav19/c.txt
/user/mudgal_abhinav19

7. get ---alternate of copytolocal


***********************************
hadoop fs -ls /
What do you mean by root of hadoop here which you are ls ing?

cd /etc/hadoop/conf
Somebody already configured it.


hdfs://ip-172-31-20-89.us-west-2.compute.internal:8020  NameNode 8020port
NameNode is a machine
Machine has an IP.


hadoop fs -ls hdfs://ip-172-31-20-89.us-west-2.compute.internal:8020  
It is same as hadoop fs -ls /

If setup in laptop--installed hadoop directly
hadoop fs -ls hdfs://lcalhost:/8020

8. Delete
hadoop fs -rm /user/mudgal_abhinav19/a.txt
