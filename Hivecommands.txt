To ways to connect to hive
1.hiveshell
2.huewebview 


/user/hive/warehouse where actual data of hive stored.
everydatabase we create is a directory in hdfs;
Commands
1.show databases;
2.create database if not exists abh;
3.use abh;

HIVEs area
hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/abh.db

4.create table abh.drivers(
    > driverID INT,
    > name STRING,
    > ssn BIGINT,
    > location STRING,
    > certified STRING,
    > wageplan STRING)
    > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
    > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    > STORED AS TEXTFILE;
	These are default anyway.
There is no data yet;
We created Manage table.
Other is external table.
Now the  abh.db directory will have another direrctory inside it called drivers 
created metastore
5.Select * from abh.drivers;

Now can load from both
1.local
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'PATH /DRIVERS.CSV' INTO TABLE ABH.DRIVERS;
d2.hdfs
LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs PATH /DRIVERS.CSV' INTO TABLE ABH.DRIVERS;

LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/mudgal_abhinav19/driver_hive/timesheet.csv' INTO TABLE ABH.DRIVERS;

After you load the file will get moved to hive. wont remain in previous place.

JOIN
SELECT d.driverId, d.name, t.total_hours, t.total_miles from abh.drivers d
JOIN (SELECT driverId, sum(hours_logged)total_hours, sum(miles_logged)total_miles FROM abh.timesheet
GROUP BY driverId ) t
ON (d.driverId = t.driverId);



IN external table location should come in last.
